# GNN-Based-Drug-Target-Binding-Affinity-Prediction
his project presents a web-based system to predict drug-target binding affinity using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformer-based protein sequence embeddings. It leverages PyTorch Geometric, RDKit, and Hugging Face models to analyze SMILES strings and protein FASTA sequences.
